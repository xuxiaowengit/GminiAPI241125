the project within with estimated time quoted  The cost was exactly as predicted in the quote and they have been great about monitoring the system and making sure it s preforming properly  I highly recommend them  We used them for both home solar as well as pool solar and have been very happy with them   I had a great experience working with Suntrek  From the start  I spoke with about   different Solar companies  and I have to say Ethan was the most transparent and explained the processes around solar better than anyone else I spoke with  Although from start to finish took a little longer than expected  not because of any fault of Suntrek  They did get my electric solar installed by the end of the year so that I could include it on my      tax returns  and then got the pool solar quickly done in early January   I have used Suntrek Solar for years  we are an Architectural firm Studio   Architects  and enjoy working with Ethan  I recently have installed a solar system on my house  and the experience was great  they are very professional  and meet all the costs and deadlines  this is why we will continue to make Suntrek s the company we will always recommend to our client   Had a fantastic experience with Ethan and his team  They installed it on time and left my yard clean after they were finished  We had a wonderful summer in our pool after getting the solar heater system installed  Been here three years and the previous owners didn t put a heater in when they put the pool in  we spent maybe   hour over the last   years in the pool  This summer was amazing  my son had a blast and the system worked great  We were in it almost daily and it was great  Thank you everyone   From start to finish  Suntrek Solar took great care of my project  They were very patient with all our questions  Made accommodations for the intricacies of our needs  Did a great job with installation and training for the system   I am delighted with my Suntrek Solar system
